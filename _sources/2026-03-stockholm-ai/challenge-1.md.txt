# Challenge 1: Regional Emission Intensity Analysis

:::{objectives}
You have access to the Statistics Sweden (SCB) data through the MCP server. You can query environmental and economic data using the scb_* tools. The goal is to analyze and compare emission intensity across Swedish regions.
:::

## Use case

::::::{exercise} Challenge
Calculate and compare the gross emission intensity (tonnes of CO2 equivalents per million SEK of economic output) for at least 3 Swedish regions (e.g., Stockholm, Gotland, Norrbotten) for the years 2019-2021.
:::::::

:::{important}

**Example workflow**
- Start by searching for tables showing emission data and econonic profile by region.
- Compute emission intensity using the formula: `Intensity = Emissions (tonnes) / GRDP (million SEK) * 1000` for the years 2019-2021.

**Ground truth**: [SCB report: Regional greenhouse gas emissions are increasing](https://www.scb.se/en/finding-statistics/statistics-by-subject-area/environment/environmental-accounts-and-sustainable-development/system-of-environmental-and-economic-accounts/pong/statistical-news/environmental-accounts--emissions-to-air-regional-statistics-2021/)

The required tables can be easily retrieved using the search function in the MCP server. However just in case if you get stuck,
here is a hint:

:::{hint}
:class: dropdown

The following tables to use
1. Emissions data: Retrieve air emissions by region and substance (GHG in tonnes CO2 equivalents) from table TAB4357
2. Economic data: Retrieve Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) by region from table TAB3138

## Futher improvements

:::::::{exercise} Optional Challenges
1. **Interactive Visualization**: Create an interactive plot showing emission intensity trends over time for multiple regions.

:::{tip}
- Instruct which library to use:
  - Generate a Python app which uses libraries like [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Gradio](https://gradio.app/), [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [Holoviz](https://holoviz.org/), [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), or [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/)
  - Use Javascript (either front-end only or full-stack) app which uses [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/), [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/), or [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/)
:::

2. **Extended Analysis**: Extend the analysis to include more years (e.g., 2015-2023) or more regions to identify longer-term trends and regional patterns.
3. **Map Visualization**: Create a map visualization to show the distribution of emissions across different regions.

:::{tip}
- Instruct which library to use:
  - Generate a Python library like [ipyleaflet](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/) or [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/)
  - Generate Javascript app which uses [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)

  For data handling, SCB returns JSON-stat responses which can be processed using:
  - Python: [pyjstat](https://pypi.org/project/pyjstat/)
  - JavaScript: [jsonstat-toolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonstat-toolkit)
