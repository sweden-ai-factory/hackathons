# Challenge 2: Inflation Measures Analysis

:::{objectives}
You have access to the
- Statistics Sweden (SCB) data through the `scb-opendata-mcp` server. You can query economic data using the scb_* tools.
- Rikskbanken data through the `swemo-mcp` for CPI, CPIF, GDP, and other economic indicators.

The goal is to analyze and compare different inflation measures in Sweden.
:::

## Use case

::::::{exercise} Challenge
Retrieve and compare the following inflation measures for Sweden for the years 2020-2025:
- CPI (Consumer Price Index)
- CPIF (Consumer Price Index with fixed interest rate)
- CPIF-XE (CPIF excluding energy products)
- HICP (Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices)

Calculate the annual inflation rate for each measure and visualize the trends.
:::::::

:::{important}

**Example workflow**
- Start by searching for tables showing the different inflation measures.
- Retrieve the monthly or annual data for the specified measures. Aggregate them if needed.

**Ground truth**: [SCB report: Different measures of inflation](https://www.scb.se/en/finding-statistics/statistics-by-subject-area/prices-and-economic-trends/price-statistics/consumer-price-index-cpi/pong/statistical-news/consumer-price-index-cpi-february-2026/)

## Further improvements

:::::::{exercise} Optional Challenges
1. **Interactive Visualization**: Create an interactive plot showing the trends of different inflation measures over time.

:::{tip}
- Instruct which library to use:
  - Generate a Python app which uses libraries like [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Gradio](https://gradio.app/), [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [Holoviz](https://holoviz.org/), [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), or [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/)
  - Use Javascript (either front-end only or full-stack) app which uses [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/), [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/), or [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/)

  For data handling, SCB returns JSON-stat responses which can be processed using:
  - Python: [pyjstat](https://pypi.org/project/pyjstat/)
  - JavaScript: [jsonstat-toolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonstat-toolkit)
:::

2. **Extended Analysis**: Extend the analysis to include more years (e.g., 2010-2025) to identify longer-term trends.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze the correlation between different inflation measures and the GDP (Gross Domestic Product).

:::{tip}
- Instruct which library to use:
  - Generate a Python app which uses libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scipy, Seaborn etc.
