# Setup

:::{admonition} TLDR; The Endpoints
:class: hint

While we provide instructions below for several tools (`npm`, `uv`, `opencode` etc.). If you are in a hurry, here are the information about the **inference and MCP endpoints**
for your reference.

- Endpoint for the model:  <http://mimer-aif-hackathon.icedc.se/v1>
- Endpoint for Riksbanken MCP: <http://mimer-aif-hackathon.icedc.se/swemo/sse>
- Endpoint for SCB/Statistics Sweden MCP: <http://mimer-aif-hackathon.icedc.se/scb/mcp>

We have also added a skills repo for the SCB MCP available here: <https://github.com/ashwinvis/scb-opendata-skills>

In this hackathon, we execute MistralAI's Devstral 2 Small (256K, 24B) in H100 GPUs, served through multiple instances of vLLM. The model was chosen as it fits consumer hardware and therefore can simulating a home development for those who never did it.
:::

## Recommended Tools

The following tools are often useful for either installing MCP servers or building the final application for your hackathon.

- Node.js via `npm` and `npx` commands: Follow instructions at <https://nodejs.org/en/download>
- Python via `uv` and `uvx` commands: Follow instructions at <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/> 
- **(Optional, but convenient to have)** Git for cloning skill repositories instead of downloading. We use `git clone` command in instructions below. Follow instructions at <https://git-scm.com/> to get `git`.

::::::::{admonition} Note on virtual environments
:class: tip

We have prepared a guide on {ref}`python-venv` if you are unfamiliar with it.

## Standard installation with open-weights LLM from Mimer



For this Hackathon, we support the usage of OpenCode as it is a free and opensource tool that do not require any third-party account. 
If you want to use other tools (Claude Code, Mistral Vibe, etc), you can directly refer to their documentation and configuration of custom endpoints.

:::::::{tabs}

::::{group-tab} Windows

:::{important}
Please notice that while there are instructions for Windows, we strongly support using Windows Subsystem for Linux (see **WSL** in the next tab) as the development environment is more robust and secure (i.e., it is easier to administrate Python environments). 
:::

1. Download the OpenCode at its official [download webpage](https://opencode.ai/download).
2. Open OpenCode once, and close it.
3. On Windows Explorer, open `%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode`
4. Create a file named `opencode.jsonc`, and insert the JSON configuration **given below**, replacing the entire content, if the file was not empty:
5. Now reopen OpenCode.

::::

::::{group-tab} WSL / Linux / Mac

1. In your terminal, download OpenCode by running[^link-to-install-script]

```sh
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

2. Run `opencode`, and then type `exit` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
3. Execute the following to prepare the configuration file
```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/
cd ~/.config/opencode/
touch opencode.jsonc
``` 
4. Then use your favourite text editor to replace the contents of `opencode.jsonc`,
   with the JSON configuration **given below**.
5. Run `opencode` and start using it! 

**(Optional)**: you can also run `opencode web --port 4096 --hostname 0.0.0.0` and start a web instance of it in your browser, 
which will then be available on `http://localhost:4096`.

[^link-to-install-script]: It is good practice to the read the install script and verify it. Click here <https://opencode.ai/install> and read it. Alternatively, you may also use `npm i -g opencode-ai` if you have a Node.js installlation.


::::::{callout} OpenCode JSON configuration

}
```
::::::

Use `Ctrl+P` to access menus and switch the models and/or the MCPs. You can also use slash commands like `/models` and `/mcps`. You should now be able to select the model **(Devstral 2 Small (256k))**.


### Skills

Agent [skills](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills/) can be added by running the commands:

:::::::{tabs}

::::{group-tab} Windows with Git Bash

Launch Git bash from the start menu. It should [look like this](https://gitforwindows.org/img/gw1.png). Then run the following commands.

```console
$ mkdir -p $USERPROFILE/.config/opencode/skills

$ git clone https://github.com/ashwinvis/scb-opendata-skills
$ cp -r scb-opendata-skills/skills/*  $USERPROFILE/.config/opencode/skills/
```

::::{group-tab} WSL/Linux/MacOS
```console
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills

$ git clone https://github.com/ashwinvis/scb-opendata-skills
$ cp -r scb-opendata-skills/skills/*  ~/.config/opencode/skills/
```
